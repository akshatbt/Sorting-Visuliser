# Sorting-Visuliser
In this project we will be using SDL(Simple DIrect media layer) library to make a sorting visuliser. As the name suggests (sorting visuliser), this porgram will sort some values(in our case these values will be vertical lines of differnt lengths) either in desending or ascending order. SDL will provide us the proper window to carry out all these animations.

# How to run the program:
One must simply have SDL setuped on their system, and they are good to go.
